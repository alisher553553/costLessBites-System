# CostLessBites PoS Simulation

## üìã Project Overview

**CostLessBites Catering** is a new service launching at Concordia University to provide healthy and budget-friendly meals for students, employees, and their families. This project simulates the **Point of Sale (PoS)** system that processes both on-demand and prepaid card-based orders.

The system includes:
- `Sales`: Tracks meal categories and totals.
- `PrePaiCard`: Stores prepaid meal card data.
- `PoS`: Handles combined sales and card logic.
- `PoSDemo`: A menu-driven program to test system functionalities.
